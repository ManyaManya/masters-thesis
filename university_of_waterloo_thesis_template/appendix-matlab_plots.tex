\chapter{Radii Estimates for ICG Aggregates in HCPBF }
%======================================================================
For aggregating nanoparticles, the size of the aggregates may be significant in optical density calculations within HCPBF. Here we calculate the potential range of ICG radii from the data presented in Chapter 4. While the experimental and calculated number density for particles within the fiber seem to agree, this study only takes into account scattering effects which may no be applicable to fluorescing particles. However, this assumption would certainly be valid when considering dielectric particles dispersed in liquid fibers. \\

For ICG dispersed in water, molecule aggregate radii have been measured between $2nm - 200nm$ \cite{dedora}, with J-aggregates forming at radii $>50nm$\cite{weigand}. Due to the low concentration samples of dye used in out experiments, the lower range of molecule diameter is expected, meeting the Raleigh scattering approximation condition $\frac{2\pi r}{\lambda} <<1$, the scattering cross-section is
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_0 = \frac{2\pi^5 (2r_{particle})^6}{3\lambda^4}(\frac{N^2 -1}{N^2+2})^2
	\label{raleigh}
\end{equation}
where $N=\frac{n_{particle}}{n_{solvent}}$. After applying the parameters above and (\ref{raleigh}) to (\ref{OD}), the estimated concentration of ICG molecules for optically dense medium ($OD_{fiber}=1$) has a range of $N_{particle} = 1.5\times 10^8 \sim 2.0\times 10^{14}$ molecules and $N_{particle} = 8.2\times 10^7 \sim 1.1\times 10^{14}$ molecules for 1550nm and 800nm HCPBF respectively varying the ICG aggregate radii within the approximation condition. \\

For calculations of optical density with ICG molecules in the  1550nm HCPBF, the core radius is taken as $r_{core} = 5\pm 0.05\mu m$ with beam waist $w_0 = 4.5 \pm 0.05\mu m$. For this $L_{fiber}=1cm$  piece of fiber, the number of molecules contained in a perfectly filled core is expected to be
\begin{equation}
	N_{particle} = M_{ICG}*C*V_{fiber}=\frac{1 mol}{774.98g}*\frac{4mg}{1dm^3}*\pi(5\mu m)^2(1cm) = 2.441\times10^9 molecules
\end{equation}
Using the measured optical density in the fiber, Fig.\ref{fig:icg_fluor}b the estimated radius of the aggregate ICG molecules is $r_{particle} = 13.7 \pm 0.2$nm.
Carrying out the same calculations for the $L_{fiber}=2cm$ 800nm HCPBF, the number of molecules contained in a perfectly filled core will be $N_{particle}=2.54\times10^9$.  The fiber has a core radius $r_{core} = 3.75 \pm0.05\mu m$ with beam waist $w_0 = 2.75 \pm 0.05$ and using the measured optical density in the fiber, Fig.\ref{fig:icg_fluor_800hc}a, the estimated radius of the aggregate ICG molecules is $r_{particle} = 11.5 \pm 0.26$nm. These molecule radii are well in agreement, but since the 800nm HCPBF ICG solution is a slightly lower concentration, the average $r_{particle}$ is expected to form slightly smaller aggregates.
