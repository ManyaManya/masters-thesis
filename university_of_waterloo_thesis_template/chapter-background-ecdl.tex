\subsubsection{Future Work}
While the results of suspended ICG particles are promising and show a proof-of-concept, the progression to suspended CNTs in HCPCF is incomplete. The initial tests with a sorted CNTs sample were inconclusive and further investigation is needed to produce a fluorescent sample. Future experimental efforts will hopefully lead to uses of CNTs in fiber-integrated devices. Besides the CNT samples, one of the main challenges that remains is obtaining a consistent and high coupling to the 1550nm HCPCF. Butt-coupled mechanical splicing chips fabricated for 800nm HCPCF consistently achieve coupling around 75-80\% and robustly hold the fibers together\cite{maruf}, but the same recipe does not produce high-fidelity butt-coupled mechanical splicing chips for 1550nm HCPCF. This is another avenue that needs to be explored but it is likely to be solved with modest efforts.\\
After the implementation of the aforementioned improvements, future prospects include integrating the suspended particle-filled HCPCF into a narrow linewidth external cavity semiconductor laser (NLECSL) as a gain medium. A potential NLECSL set-up using the common Littrow configuration depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:laser}(a).

Narrow line-width dye lasers have already been made using liquid dyes as gain medium\cite{shafer, duarte} with applications nonlinear\cite{norwood} and atomic optics\cite{stuke} . With organic dyes like ICG having wide fluorescence spectrum a tunable laser is desirable, but CNTs typically have fluorescence linewidth around 4-6nm when isolated and ~20nm in bulk samples\cite{tsyboulski} will have promise in a fixed-wavelength cavity. For single-wavelength laser configurations, fiber-integrated systems have been demonstrated using fiber Bragg-gratings as end-reflector of an external cavity system\cite{ding}. An easy integration if using fiber splicing chips Fig.\ref{fig:laser}(b).
