\subsection{Experimental Outcomes}
Determined the bandgap of liquid-filled fibers of $H_2O$ and $D_2O$ 
Measured the interaction of suspened ICG particles with the mode of the fiber
results show the potential of creating a fluorescent light source with liquid core fibers
\subsubsection{CNTs}
CNT samples from QuIN lab
measured absorption of selectively sorted sample
no fluoresence - need to do concentration-based experiemnts
furthure with nonsorted CNT sample in D2O
