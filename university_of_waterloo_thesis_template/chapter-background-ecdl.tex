\subsection{Future Work}
After the completion of the experiments with CNT samples and improvements are made to the fiber-coupling into 1550nm HCPCF, future prospects include integrating the suspended particle-filled HCPCF into a narrow linewidth external cavity semiconductor laser (NLECSL) as a gain medium.\\
