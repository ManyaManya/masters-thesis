\begin{center}\textbf{Abstract}\end{center}
This thesis is a study of fluorescent nanoparticles suspended in liquids within hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. Common  common solvents, deionized water and deuterium dioxide(D${}_2$O), were used to replace the air in hollow-core photonic crystal fibers and determine bandgap and loss effects on the waveguide. A fluorescent dye, indocyanine green, was then used to test the interaction of the fiber mode with particles suspended within the fiber. Following promising results, the use of carbon nanotubes, a nanomaterial with desirable optical properties is discussed and their overlap with the bandgaps of liquid-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fibers is determined.

\begin{center}\textbf{Acknowledgements}\end{center}
I'd first like to thank the members of my thesis committee, Prof. Na Young Kim, Prof. Wei Tsen, and Prof. Michal Bacjsy for their effort in reading and proving me with feedback on my thesis. I would also like to thank Prof. Kim for her role as my advisor and Prof. Bajcsy for his additional guidance and insights that helped me learn and progress on this work. I owe a great thanks to those who assisted in components of this project: HeeBong Yang for his help with the carbon nanotube samples, Yujia Yuan and Dr. Rubayet Al Maruf for their time and knowledge in the cleanroom and help fabricating the fiber splicing chips. Additionally, I am grateful to and Paul Anderson and Sai Sreesh Venuturumilli for their patience in teaching me essential lab skills.
