A little explanation\\
\section{Indocyanine Green}
Indocyanine green (ICG) - a fluorescent dye often used in microscopy imaging\cite{farrakhova, spartalis} - was dissolved in water and put into HCPBF due to its excitation and emission wavelength overlap with the bandgap of fully-filled 1550nm and core-filled 800nm HCFCP. This particular dye is an organic semiconductor with Homo-Lumo gap calculations estimating a $~2$eV energy gap, with variations depending on the solvent\cite{Fang}. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels in organic semiconductors are parallel to the maximum valence and minimum conduction, and the aforementioned energy gap falls within the range of energy bandgaps found in inorganic semiconductors.

The following section details the the optical properties of ICG and measurements of the optical properties when confined in HCPBF.
\subsection{Experiment Set-Up}
The experimental set-up for the dye-filled HCPBF is very similar to that of the previously introduced HCPBF set-up, but includes a few additions. A fiber beam splitter was added between the fiber patch coming from the laser couplet and the bare fiber to monitor input power and wavelength. For fluorescence detection out of the fiber, a front-face fluorescence collection scheme was used and a long pass filter was placed in the path in order to filter out the incident light from the fluorescence. 
Additionally, a fiber clamp was placed on a translation stage to control the position and angle at which the bare fiber is positioned in the mechanical splicer chip. The prior development of these chips done by lab members of NPQO\cite{maruf} tuned the fabrication recipe for coupling between 130$\mu$m to 125$\mu$m diameter fibers, specifically measuring the coupling between 800nm HCPBF to PM780HP fibers, resulting in a production of chips highly consistent in diameter. The 1550nm HCPBF however, has a diameter of 120$\mu$m. Mechanical splicer chips of 120$\mu$m to125$\mu$m diameter fibers are fabricated along with the 130$\mu$m to 125$\mu$m, but they are not of consistent quality and the majority of chips are over-exposed leading to the fibers to be loose and not level with each other in the chip. This resulted in average coupling rates of $>10\%$ if supported by the chip structure only.

\subsubsection{Sample Preparation}
ICG powder was purchased from MP Biomedicals in quantities of 5mg per vial. A stock solution was made by dissolving 5mg of powder in 5mL of H${}_2$O, then a low-concentration solution is made by diluting 10$\mu$L of stock solution into 2.5mL of either D${}_2$O/H${}_2$O.  In a second approximate method for making low-concentration solutions, the tip of a syringe needle was use to scoop up a small amount of dye and then dissolve it in 5-10mL of D${}_2$O/H${}_2$O, working by eye based on the hue and opacity of the dye sample (See Fig.\ref{fig:icg_setup}(c)). The absorption of the sample was then measured in a cuvette and fitted to the concentration-based absorption cross-section data to find the concentration of the sample.

\subsubsection{ Absorption Cross-Section}
ICG absorbs wavelengths between 600-900nm. The absorption is largely bimodal, with the greatest excitation occurring at 780nm and 700nm, but transforms into a monomeric distribution at 780nm at low concentrations and 700nm at high concentrations.

Due to the chemical formation of ICG, the absorption of the molecule when dissolved in a solvent is highly concentration-dependent. ICG is made up of monomers, which are a type of molecule that can react with other monomers to form polymer chains. In the case of ICG, its monomers react with each other to form dimers, a chain of two joint monomers.
With higher concentrations monomers are closer to each other, causing the molecules to have an increased likelihood to shift from monomers to dimers, which in turn are less likely to be excited and shift the center absorption wavelength. The concentration of monomers $M$ to dimers $D$ is governed by the equilibrium reaction:
\begin{equation}
	M+M\rightleftarrows D
\end{equation}
and law of mass action relation concentration
\begin{equation}
	[D] =  K_D[M]^2
\end{equation}
where $K_D$ is the dimerization constant. Written in terms of concentration $C$ and mole fractions, $[M] = x_MC= (1-x_D)C $ and $[D]=\frac{x_D}{2}C$, the  mole fraction of dimers can be written in terms of the dimerization constant and concentration.
\begin{equation}
	x_D = 1 + \frac{1}{4K_DC} - \sqrt{\big( 1 + \frac{1}{4K_DC}\big)^2-1}
	\label{xd}
\end{equation}
The absorption cross-section model for ICG\cite{mauerer, philip} will be an average of the effects of the of monomers and dimers, where $\sigma_M$ and $\sigma_D$ are the monomer and dimer absorption cross-sections respectively.
\begin{equation}
	\sigma = x_M \sigma_M + x_D \sigma_D = \sigma_M - x_D(\sigma_M - \sigma_D)
	\label{abc}
\end{equation}
Plugging (\ref{xd}) into (\ref{abc}), remaining parameters can be found by doing a linear regression fit to absorption cross-section vs. concentration data from literature. The expected absorption cross-section can be calculated for any concentration. For ICG dissolved in H${}_2$O, the existing literature presents some variation and so the upper/lower bounds and average were taken, while data for ICG dissolved in D${}_2$O was based on \cite{holzer}. The behavior in H${}_2$O and D${}_2$O are quite similar and are plotted in Fig.\ref{fig:icg abs plots}. At lower concentrations the absorption cross-section is slightly greater for D${}_2$O than H${}_2$O, with the reverseÂ for high concentrations.

\subsubsection{ Photostability}
At high concentrations, ICG behaves as a  ``J-aggregate'', a category of dyes that shift in the absorption band to larger wavelengths in certain solvents. When mixed into water and other solvents, ICG shifts over time to a center wavelength of 893nm. This process can be accelerated under high heat. In high-concentration forms (in the range of 1000ppm solutions) \cite{rotermund},  J-aggregates can be stored at room temperature for several months. However, in such a state the dye will be too optically dense to observe any optical excitation and when diluted to perform such measurements, the J-aggregates will begin to detach into smaller molecules within 24hrs.  The effects of dye concentration on storage life in aqueous solutions becomes a tricky balance at single-digit ppm concentrations. At that concentration, the fluorescence intensity of the dye is at its greatest but it degrades to undetectable levels in just a couple of hours under optimal storage conditions\cite{landsman, saxena}. The rate of deterioration occurs linearly based on the initial concentration of ICG\cite{holzer}, but the amount of light exposure of the solution will also exasperate the degradation rate\cite{saxena}.

\subsubsection{ Fluorescence}
Photoluminescence in the dye is observed in the range of 750-900nm, therefore overlapping with the absorption spectrum. The peak emission wavelength for ICG varies within 800nm-820nm\cite{philip, saxena} when excited at 780nm, and decreases as solution concentration increases. The dimerization effects are attributed to (a) the formation of weakly fluorescent ICG molecular aggregates at high concentrations (b) self-quenching and (c) re-absorption of the emitted fluorescence by the ICG molecules due to overlap of the absorption and emission spectra. In the J-aggregate form the excitation wavelength shifts to 834nm and the emission peaks at 890nm although low quantum yield and strong light scattering does not lend to accurate measurements\cite{rotermund}.
