\subsection{ICG in HCPCF}
Low-concentration samples of dye were prepared and used it to fill a 800nm HCPCF core and 1550nm HCPCF core and cladding. The measured absorption cross-section of the dye, shown in Fig.\ref{fig:icg_absp}, presents additional absorption effects caused by the fiber, notably the narrower bandgap of the 800nm HCPCF. Additionally, there is an observed 18nm shift in the peak absorption from 778nm to 796nm in the 1550nm bandgap-shifted liquid-filled fiber, while the 800mn liquid-core fiber has an insignificant 4nm shift in peak from 775nm to 771nm.\\

For 800nm core-filled HCPCF, ICG solutions were prepared with H${}_2$O and  D${}_2$O solvents, but fluorescence was only guided in the D${}_2$O. In the 800HC fiber there was already significant loss coming from the narrow bandgap in combination with lower refractive index contrast of using a liquid medium, as half of the absorption spectrum is outside the bandgap; The absorption of effects of H${}_2$O in the NIR (discussed in chapter 2) and re-absorption from the overlapping excitation-emission spectra is suspected to be greater than the number of emitted photons. The fluorescence guided in the 800nm HCPCF was also influenced by the bandgap, shown in Fig.\ref{fig:icg_fluor_800hc}b. The emission had a large shifts in peak for excitation between $745 - 775$nm - wavelengths at the edge of the bandgap and with high absorption effects - varying peak fluorescence between $800$ and $820$nm while for excitation above 775nm the fluorescence stayed centered at 805nm. \\
Fluorescence was also in ICG-filled 1550nm HCPCF with D${}_2$O as solvent, which had the best ratio of fluorescence intensity to emission intensity (``fraction of fluorescence''). For a 4ppm ICG sample the fraction of fluorescence are compared in Fig.\ref{fig:icg_fluor} for excitation wavelengths below the emission wavelength range.
The peak fluorescence in the cuvette was at 820nm, but was shifted down 10nm to 810nm in the fiber and the fraction of fluorescence in 1550nm HCPCF was $\sim35$x greater than that measured through the cuvette.
For the 3.7ppm sample in core-filled 800nm HCPCF similar fraction of fluorescence to the cuvette sample were measured at the excitation wavelength of peak absorption(778nm).

At the maximum absorption wavelength, the fraction of fluorescence and output power at the excitation wavelength are measured as a function of the input power, shown in Fig.\ref{fig:icg_fluor_800hc}c. The fraction of fluorescence peaks at an input power of $50\mu W$, while the output power increases logarithmically and appears to approaching a limit on the transmission. Overall, the fluorescence efficiency is of $0.00051\%$ in the 800nm HCPCF $\lambda_{ex}=778$ and for 1550nm HCPCF $0.014\%$ at $\lambda_{ex}=740$nm, which is comparable to other optofluidic waveguides \cite{vezenov}.
