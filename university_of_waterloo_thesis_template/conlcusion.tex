Experimentally confirm the scaling laws for liquid-filled fibers of H${}_2$O and D${}_2$O. Measured the interaction of suspended ICG particles with the mode of the fiber and demonstrate the potential of creating a fluorescent light source out of suspended particles in liquid core fibers. Introduce unique optical properties of semiconducting CNTs and present an argument as an ideal fluorescent nanoparticle light source and some initial experiemnts and roadmap.
